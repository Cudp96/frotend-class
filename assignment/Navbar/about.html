        <h3>About Us</h3>
        <div class="idea">
          <p>Everyone has a favorite restaurant that he or she loves to eat at. The best restaurant to go to in Altoona is The Olive Garden. This peaceful place has the most delicious food for all the Italian food lovers out there. The Olive Garden is the most exquisite place to eat and is truly the finest restaurant in town.
          Every time I walk in to the Olive Garden I obtain the best feeling. No matter how many times I come, I always love to observe what is around me. Each and every comforting smile the employees have on their faces and the soft Italian music playing, always makes me feel relaxed. When I breathe in the aroma of the Italian food, it always reminds me of how hungry I am. The uniquely textured walls produce a smooth yet flowing look. It is almost as I am in a famous building in Italy. The viny plants that clasp to the walls ever so freely give it a natural appearance. The marble tiled floor beneath me gives the restaurant a clean yet warm appearance.
          The host's kind and gentle eyes look at their customers and politely ask for the number of the party attending and the smoking preference they prefer. They have soft cushion seats that let my body sink right down in them. I always notice the quiet atmosphere around me. This makes everyone's mood ever so noticeable. The Olive Garden always seems to have the most friendly customers. The windows that surround the tables present an open feeling, almost as if I was eating outside.
          When the food is brought, I can always feel the chilled salad plate being handed to me. The crispy garden salad that is lightly coated with ranch dressing and not to mention those thin, round, red onions that I particularly dislike. Somewhere around me there always lay a deep burgundy color glass of the Red Wine, or a soft pale crystal like glass of White Zinfandel.Once I stepped inside the restaurant I automatically could hear the music playing at a moderate level and the laughter of the customers. Right off the back the restaurant's ambiance had a positive vibe. Mindful, it was a Saturday late afternoon. Mary Jane Burger and Brew is a local restaurant trying to stay true to its past. The granddaughter of the original owner now runs the place with the intention of serving good quality food where the ingredients are fresh, mouth watering, and surely not filled with antibiotics and all that other genetically modified elements found in processed foods. The vintage, rustic looking place, holds a small town atmosphere with a big taste.</p>

          <p>The host sat my sister and I at a table in the middle of the dining area. A giant window let sunlight flood into the room and the speakers provided a good backdrop of music to help engage conversation. The restaurant itself seems fairly modern: leather seating, dark wood tables, and mason jar for glasses. It is the epitome of a hang out spot for any teen, millennial, or elder meetup. The staff caters to the needs of the customers and are always ready to help out in any way possible.</p>
